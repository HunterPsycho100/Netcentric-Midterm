        <h2>Most Loyal Customer</h2>
        <h4>Naruto Uzumaki</h4>
        <p>Ramen Ichiraku is Naruto Uzumaki's favourite dining establishment. He eats there regularly – usually stopping by
            between missions – and he is often joined by Iruka Umino, another frequent customer. Because Naruto has been a
            loyal customer for most of his life, Teuchi and his daughter, Ayame, were among the few people in Konoha not to
            treat Naruto with animosity during his youth. Naruto takes Hinata Hyūga to Ramen Ichiraku for their first date;
            in the anime, this in turn causes Hinata to become a regular customer, to the point that she has won at least
            one of its eating contests, a record that Chōji and Chōchō Akimichi have yet to break.
