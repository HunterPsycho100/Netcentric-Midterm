                <td>Shoyu ramen soup is a clear, brown broth flavored with soy sauce (shoyu). The soup is usually
                    made of chicken broth but often contains other meats such as pork, beef or fish depending on the
                    region. Shoyu ramen is the most common type of ramen and is usually what is served when the menu
                    does not specify a specific type of soup.

                    down until they dissolve into a cloudy white broth. The thick, creamy soup is also often flavored
                    with chicken broth and pork fat.

                <td>Miso</td>
                <td>Miso ramen soup is flavored with soybean paste (miso), resulting in a thick, brown soup with a rich,
                    complex flavor. The style originated in Hokkaido where the long cold winters spurred the need for a
                    heartier type of ramen soup, but it has spread to the point where it can be found pretty much
                    anywhere in Japan.
